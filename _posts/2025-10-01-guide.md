Hi Leo from the future,  

It’s nice (I think…?) to see you here. This is Leo from Oct 2025, writing from the living room at Cambridgelaan 138. The doors of my PhD adventure are about to open. Maybe I should try to give myself some guidelines to face this? Let’s see if any of these ideas will work.  All of this is written through the eyes of a just-graduated MSc student, it’ll be fun to revisit in a few years. Let’s go!  


## 1. Plan Early, Plan Often  
Start with a rough trajectory of the project -- even if it’s vague, it's still a good idea. What is a *great* idea? Re-plan and test it often. Adjust your shot based on what you’ve learned. Make your plan multi-level, something in the long-term, and something in the short-term.

The plan will always evolve, but having a map helps you see where you are.  


## 2. Do 3 Things Per Day  
Each day, set 3 **achievable** tasks -- not 20. More than that is usually too ambitious and makes it feel like no progress is happening, dangerous stuff. This “3 things” method builds momentum and gives daily wins. It’s also a great way to link **macro-level planning** (your goals) to **micro-level action** (today).  


## 3. Write Early, Write Often  
Don’t wait until the last 2 months to write.  Keep a living document with:  
- Research questions.  
- Methods you tried.  
- Figures as soon as you have them.

Short-term, this makes weekly meetings easier to prepare.  
Long-term, big works (papers, thesis) won’t start from a blank page.  

Also, try to be consistent with the work you produce (reuse templates, formatting for figures and slides, etc.)

## 4. Log!  
Keep track of what you’re doing.  

- For code → meaningful README files, version history, notes.  
- For daily life → my current go-to is a paper notebook.  

Logging tips I want to try:  
  - Margin symbols as a fast tagging system
  - ALWAYS put the date on top and some time references.
  - Leave 2–4 blank pages at the front → use as a Table of Contents.

Future-me will thank past-me for leaving breadcrumbs.  


## 5. Milestones  
Celebrate every step forward — papers you read, code that runs, presentations you give, even the smallest wins. These moments add up, and when motivation dips, looking back will remind you just how far you’ve come.

Big goals can feel overwhelming, so break them down:
- “Clean dataset.”  
- “Run baseline model.”  
- “Draft related work section.”  

Share progress early with advisors/peers — even if imperfect. Feedback earlier = less wasted time later.  

## 6. Separate Exploration vs. Production  
Not all work is the same.  

- **Exploration** = reading, brainstorming, quick experiments.  
- **Production** = clean code, polished figures, paper writing.  

Don’t mix them too much in one session. It saves mental energy.  

## 7. Communication Is a Research Skill  
It’s not just about coding or results. Being able to explain your work is equally important:  

- Lab meetings → clear, short updates.  
- Papers → write simply, not fancy.  
- Conferences → talk to people, not slides.  

Good communication makes your work visible and useful. Every time you explain your research, you sharpen it. Don’t waste chances to talk about your work.

## 8. Protect Your Energy  
This journey is a marathon, not a sprint. You’re not just a brain at a desk -- you’re the athlete running this PhD. Treat yourself that way.

Sleep, movement, and breaks aren’t luxuries — they’re fuel. Learn your rhythms and play to your strengths.

Protect the human behind the research. Take care of yourself first — the science will follow.

Take care of the human running the PhD.

That’s the starter set. Maybe in a few years, Future Leo will laugh at how naïve this sounds… or maybe he’ll smile and say, *“yep, those things actually mattered.”*  

Either way, these are my rules of thumb as the journey begins.
