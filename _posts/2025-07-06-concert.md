The power of music, they say.

But what *is* it really? Just vibrations, right? Air molecules moving, hitting your eardrums. Pure physics. Frequencies. (Shout out to Fourier, tbf great call. He saw the truth in the wave.)

> *We learned more from a three-minute record, baby*
> *Than we ever learned in school*

And yet, we *feel* so much more. Somehow, those waves carry stories. Identity. Memory. Truth. Well, those are vibrations hitting your toes, shaking your knees, traveling up to your heart and head. Vibrations rising from the floor of the stadium during the concert. San Siro feels like it’s about to crumble under your feet.

> *Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound*  
> *I can feel my heart begin to pound*

Vibrations -- like the shaking in the hands of the old man next to me, trying to record the anthem of his youth.
A 1984 song that still hits like the first time.
His eyes are full of tears as he softly whispers the lyrics.

> *Well, we made a promise we swore we'd always remember*  
> *No retreat, baby, no surrender*

(And there was certainly *no* retreat from him, climbing his way up to the third ring of the stadium.  
Those stairs are brutal.)

Songs like that -- you *feel* them.  
They aren't just listened to; they’re *lived*.

Man, you feel it when the music hits right. When it’s the *good* stuff.

(Warning: boomer opinion incoming.)  
Most music today? It’s fast food.  
A 3-minute dopamine hit, thrown away after a few plays.  
(And yes, I enjoy modern stuff too! But come on... real gems like that? Few and far between.)

Great music stays.  
It *sticks*.  
Forty years later, and it's still here.  
Still moving people. Still shaking stadium floors.
You simply cannot ignore it. 

The concert opens with a song about being there. Keeping promises. Holding your ground through the storms.

And it ends with one about the *cost* of facing all that.  
Because life isn’t just the ''American Dream'' -- you want it, you get it. Keeping promises is not easy. 
It is much more complex than that.

> *Man, I’m just tired and bored with myself*

It’s stagnation too - the feeling of emptiness, of having lost the meaning of life. Monotony.
God, I hate those phrases. The so-called “deep” lines everyone throws around like they mean something.

What do they mean - *concretely*?

Sometimes, these songs are like mirrors. You can just walk by them -- background noise on the radio.  
Or you can stop. *Listen*.  
And in doing so, you start to notice details reflected back at you. Things you hadn’t seen before.
And so those deep phrases begin to take on concrete shape. You start to see what they actually mean in your life.

> *I check my look in the mirror*  
> *Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face*

Maybe it’s about the difficulty of getting older. Feeling the time slipping away.

Or maybe it’s about a queer person, hidden in that closet. Dancing in the dark behind its doors.

Maybe it’s just me, here, trying to write through the uncertainty ahead.

Everyone has their own steps.  

*Tutti hanno i propri gradini.*

(had that line saved in my notes since 2016 -- wrote it by the sea. Finally found its moment.)

> *Hey there, baby, I could use just a little help…*

Nothing happens without that first little spark.
If we want to change anything, we have to make a move -- no matter how small.

And all those voices coming together -- a spark from the light beam igniting the whole crowd.

> *You can't start a fire*  
> *You can't start a fire without a spark*

Do something.  
Anything.  
Move.
