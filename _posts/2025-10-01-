Hi Leo from the future,  

It’s nice (I think…?) to see you here. This is Leo from Oct 2025, writing from the living room at Cambridgelaan 138. The doors of my PhD adventure are about to open. Maybe I should try to give myself some guidelines to face this? Let’s see if any of these ideas will work.  All of this is written through the eyes of a just-graduated MSc student, it’ll be fun to revisit in a few years. Let’s go!  


## 1. Plan Early, Plan Often  
Start with a rough trajectory of the project -- even if it’s vague, it's still a good idea. What is a *great* idea? Re-plan and test it often. Adjust your shot based on what you’ve learned. Make your plan multi-level, something in the long-term, and something in the short-term.

The plan will always evolve, but having a map helps you see where you are.  


## 2. Do 3 Things Per Day  
Each day, set 3 **achievable** tasks -- not 20. More than that is usually too ambitious and makes it feel like no progress is happening, dangerous stuff.  

This “3 things” method builds momentum and gives daily wins. It’s also a great way to link **macro-level planning** (your goals) to **micro-level action** (today).  


## 3. Write Early, Write Often  
Don’t wait until the last 2 months to write.  Keep a living document with:  
- Research questions.  
- Methods you tried.  
- Figures as soon as you have them.  

Short-term, this makes weekly meetings easier to prepare.  
Long-term, big works (papers, thesis) won’t start from a blank page.  

## 4. Log!  
Keep track of what you’re doing.  

- For code → meaningful README files, version history, notes.  
- For daily life → my current go-to is a paper notebook.  

Logging tips I want to try:  
  - ALWAYS put the date on top and some time references.
  - Margin symbols for quick
  - Make (and update) a 

Future-me will thank past-me for leaving breadcrumbs.  


## 5. Milestones  
Track your achievements: papers read, code milestones, presentations, small wins.  
When motivation dips, reread the list.  

Break big tasks into mini-milestones:  
- “Clean dataset.”  
- “Run baseline model.”  
- “Draft related work section.”  

Share progress early with advisors/peers — even if imperfect. Feedback earlier = less wasted time later.  

## 6. Separate Exploration vs. Production  
Not all work is the same.  

- **Exploration** = reading, brainstorming, quick experiments.  
- **Production** = clean code, polished figures, paper writing.  

Don’t mix them too much in one session. It saves mental energy.  


## 7. The Reading Pyramid  
Not every paper deserves the same effort.  

- **Skim** (title, abstract, figures) → 5 minutes.  
- **Digest** (intro, conclusion, skim methods) → ~30 minutes.  
- **Deep dive** (annotate, replicate math/experiments) → hours.  


## 8. Communication Is a Research Skill  
It’s not just about coding or results. Being able to explain your work is equally important:  

- Lab meetings → clear, short updates.  
- Papers → write simply, not fancy.  
- Conferences → talk to people, not slides.  

Good communication makes your work visible and useful. Do not waste any opportunity to talk about your research.

## 9. Protect Your Energy  
This is a marathon, not a sprint. Sleep, movement, and breaks are fuel, not luxuries.  Just try to think of this as being an athlete!

Take care of the human running the PhD.

That’s the starter set. Maybe in a few years, Future Leo will laugh at how naïve this sounds… or maybe he’ll smile and say, *“yep, those things actually mattered.”*  

Either way, these are my rules of thumb as the journey begins.
