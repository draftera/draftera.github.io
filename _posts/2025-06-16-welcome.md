Hi there — and welcome to **Draftera**.

This blog doesn’t have a grand mission (yet). I’m not entirely sure where it’s going. But I know I need a place to write — a place to *think out loud*, try things, get messy, and maybe discover something in the process.

The name **Draftera** is a mix of *draft* and *tera* (aka dirt or Earth, a word from the Veneto dialect, similar to the italian terra) — the idea of a landscape made of thoughts, creative experiments, and evolving perspectives. That’s what this blog will probably be: not a polished publication, but a space for process over perfection.

Here’s what you might find here:
- Half-formed thoughts on the world, on math, on something I read on twitter
- Notes to self
- Qualcosa in italiano, qualcosa in inglese, qualcosa in *matematichese*
- Songs, books, and recipes 
- Maybe some weird ideas that I just don’t know where else to put

I’m starting this blog because I want to build a habit — to write more regularly, even when it’s imperfect. And because the act of writing *does* something. And sometimes… it just feels good. Also, having something public adds a bit of "positive pressure" to keep posting, maybe once a week? We'll see!

Thanks for stopping by. If you’re reading this, I’m glad you’re here.
